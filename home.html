								<h2>About the CoNGRaTS group<br />
								</h2>
								<p>The <a href="http://http://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a> Computational Neuroscience and Genetics Research and Technology in Science (CoNGRaTS) group is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity#Interdisciplinary_studies_and_studies_of_interdisciplinarity">multidisciplinary</a> working group dedicated to interdisciplinary research in behavioral and clinical neuroscience, biology, computer science, genetics, mathematics, medicine, pschycology, and statistics. The CoNGRaTS group brings together scientists from many fields, including basic science, clinical science, and quantitative science, all of whom share a common interest in gaining a better understanding in three specific areas: (1) how the brain perceives, learns, stores information, and makes decision; (2) how genes and genomes affect biological functions; (3) how to make scientific progress on diagnostics, treatments, cures and management of the brain and genetic disorders. </p>

								<h2>What is Computational Neuroscience?</h2>
								<p> Computational neuroscience (theoretical neuroscience) is the study of brain function in terms of the information processing properties of the structures that make up the nervous system. It is an interdisciplinary science that links the diverse fields of cognitive science, neuroscience, and psychology with computer science, electrical engineering, mathematics, physics, and statistics. </p>

								<h2>What is Computational Genetics?</h2>
								<p>Computational Genetics (computational genomics) refers to the use of computational and statistical analysis to decipher biology from genome sequences and related data, including both DNA and RNA sequence as well as other "post-genomic" data (i.e., experimental data obtained with technologies that require the genome sequence, such as genomic DNA microarrays). These, in combination with computational and statistical approaches to understanding the function of the genes and statistical association analysis, this field is also often referred to as Computational and Statistical Genetics/genomics.</p>

								<h2>Why are we so passionate about Computational Neuroscience and Genetics?</h2>
								<p> Do you know <a href="http://www2.nami.org/factsheets/mentalillness_factsheet.pdf">1 in 4 American adults suffer from a diagnosable mental disorder in any given year</a>? Do you know <a href="http://www.ftpress.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1692537&seqNum=4">more than 6,000 single gene disorders are currently known</a>, meaning that mutations in somewhere around 24% of the approximately 25,000 human genes found so far can cause genetic disorder?</p>
<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/biology/faculty/yuste/Publications/cell_bam.pdf/"> Understanding how the brain works</a> and understanding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_genomics">how genes and genomes affect biological functions</a> are two of the most fundemental and challenging problems of our time. On one hand, they help us understand who we are; on the other hand, millions of people are suffering from enormous mental, physical, and economic burdens caused by the brain and genetic disorders.  Our scientific community must play a leading role in discovering the unknowns of the brain and genome, and finding cures of the brain and genetic disorders. The multi-faceted nature of neuroscience and genetics requires that its reach is broad and multidisciplinary. Recent years have seen a rapid advancement in quantitative scientific research and a movement towards multidisciplinary study in computer science, genetics, neuroscience, and statistics, due to the emergence of complicated problems, the production of an explosive amount of data, and the development of high-performance computers. There has been a massive amount of investment in research in neuroscience and genetics from both the <a href="https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx">federal government</a> and <a href="http://www.genengnews.com/insight-and-intelligence/top-20-corporate-venture-funds/77899832/">private sector</a>s. Our science community needs to take advantage of this exciting time and the momentum to work collaboratively to apply our expertise to address some of the fundemental problems in neuroscience and genetics. </p>
